This library is useful for organizing the game's rendering into a defined and customizable order in real time. Useful if you have a lighting system, post-processing, pause, and transitions, as each needs to receive input from the other to function properly.

RenderStack was created with my libraries in mind (PPFX, Crystal, Transitions), but it can be used for other things (your things - following the RenderStack logic).
